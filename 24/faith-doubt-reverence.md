I spent ten years deconstructing my Christianity.

The eight years since? Reconstructing?

Nah, nothing so industrious.

Those I've spent playing.

Which, honestly. Was that the point all along?

support this work!

I had that real real real faith.
That real real zeal.
I went all the way.
Name a standard Evangelical doctrine,
I believed it.

Heaven? Check.
Hell? Check.
Rapture & Armageddon? Check.
Six-day creation? A 6000-year-old Earth? Check and mate.

That's how I was gonna convince them, I was taught.
Creation, the foundation of my worldview.
Evolution, the foundation of my culture's.
Aim for the foundation.
Shake people's belief in their descent from apes,
the rest of the Christian worldview follows neatly.
If Genesis; if Creation and the flood,
    then the prophets.
    If the prophets,
        then Jesus.

This was the play.
I was taught it explicitly,
and I tried it,
and made a fool of myself,
and made friends feel attacked.

It's not surprising to you,
dear reader:

this was a brittle worldview.

I spent years missing it.
Trying to get it back.
That certainty.
That blessed assurance.

You don't understand.
Every star in the sky!
Every world event.
All under control.
All predicted; foretold;
hand-picked by the Creator
for my specific
    and our collective
edification.
To draw our eyes upward.
To focus us on Himself.

And no,
that doesn't sound desirable anymore.
I don't miss it now.
But I spent the first...
three? five? of those ten years,
trying to re-achieve 
that same zealous worldview.
A version of God
that could support all the weight
of my intellectual rigor.

And God receded.

God receded.

"God becomes, and God unbecomes," said Eckhart, by way of On Being [I wish I could find the episode for you].

"God is that which cannot be known, God can only be loved," said Richard Rohr, by way of The Liturgists.

But I found all this
    receding and
        unbecoming and
            unknowability a bit,
you know.
Unbecoming.
Unsatisfying.

A spiritual counselor
gave me a chapter of a book:
Eco-Theism.
God as Vivifier; Animator;
Enlivener of all things.

And that's fine!
Poetic. A nice metaphor,
but it didn't give me a necessary God.

It always just felt like
in any of these explanations,
God is always dancing,
just out of sight,
right on the other side
of Occam's Razor.

You don't need God.
God's just a nice-to-have.
Not something to lean on
with all my intellectual weight.

I know someone still on this quest,
still reasoning toward a necessary god.
He places God in the gaps
in scientific understanding;
what we've yet to explain.
    The origin of life.
    The fine-tuning of fundamental constants.
He knows this is called a fallacy;
he does it anyway.

I have many problems with this.

Why one God?
Why not a god for every gap?
    The Origin of Life god.
    The Fine-Tuning god.
Or heck, a god for every finely-tuned constant!
    The Planck Constant god.
    The Gravitational Constant god.

Why not something altogether stranger
than "us but bigger,"
than something approximating
     human form,
     human mind,
     human agency?

And for the sake of argument,
let's go with monotheism.
One god, to fill all the gaps.
Isn't it a far cry?
Generic theism
to Christian doctrine?
Draw that line for me.
On the merits of reason alone,
how you gonna get from
"some anthropomorphic Agent, idk?"
to Heaven,
    a personal God,
    saved by grace,
    the Trinity,
    Jesus?

Friend gave me his answer.
He drew his line for me.

But anymore
I find this whole pursuit,
this whole "reasoning our way into God"
neither intellectually
nor spiritually
satisfying.

All deconstructed, bricks and boards and nails in neat rows on the ground where the house of my faith once stood

I think it's kind of a silly word, "deconstruction."

It's very popular, in the exvangelical space. Everyone's deconstructing.

Maybe we should use some other metaphor. Maybe we're wandering the woods, the desert, the wastelands, the valleys of the shadow of death, circumnavigating the border of Christianity, until we perhaps find the rumored playground.

But also, deconstruction is a metaphor that works. Pull apart every wall, shake every pole, figure out what's load-bearing. Remove the unnecessary, but carefully. No wrecking balls; no pyrotechnics. Just meticulous, exhausting inspection.

To the outsider, it seems like such a waste of time, effort, intellect. "I never had one of these houses! You can just knock it down!"

But it's necessary. Don't wanna end up an atheist with secret fundamentalist misgivings; don't wanna just join a different clique given to similar-but-differently-flavored magical thinking; don't wanna just ping-pong to the other end of the same tired dichotomies. Any good deconstruction ought to demolish the dichotomies, too.

And what more culturally potent dichotomy than the one between faith and doubt?

My deconstruction ended with a book. Finding God in the Waves, by Mike McHargue. Maybe it will help you with your deconstruction; maybe it will hit you like Eco-Theism hit me. I talked about this book in my last essay:

This did it for me. I found peace.

No more trying to reason my way to God. Let my left brain be my left brain. Let my right brain be my right. Left brain delights in reason; in intellectual pursuit; in data and facts and rigor. Turn that spotlight on God, and God recedes.

So don't turn that spotlight on God. Don't think, essentially, about God. At least not the conscious, prefrontal-cortex sort of "thinking" that we've come to associate with the word.

The less I think about God, I concluded, the more at ease I'll be.

And this has been true.

I feel much more capable of enjoying church. 

More comfortable responding "God bless you, too," when strangers wish God's blessings on me.

And eventually, I softened enough that I was able to turn on the Christian radio station in my hometown, as a sort of auto-sociology, and when they sang about God's love in everything, and I watched the vultures ride currents high above the valley floor, I thought "hell yeah. Look at those image-bearers. Surely God is bird-like. Surely God is a metaphor for the whole ecology that resulted in vultures; the landscapes and beings they feed and are fed by; that tuned their genomes; that even now tunes them imperceptibly into something new."

I stopped trying, essentially, to even have faith.

And doubt became irrelevant

A friend explained his thoughts on doubt. "If God made me, and I'm a doubter, then maybe doubt is my gift." 

I agree with this friend on many things. But this seemed off to me. I couldn't put my finger on why.

But this is it.

Faith is no longer aspirational,

and

Doubt is irrelevant.

I have exited the continuum. 

Demolished, in my own self, the dichotomy.

I am not impressed by anyone's faith or troubled by their doubt. Nor the opposite. Neither concept feels virtuous, villainous, or even salient.

I feel like the person outside the house, watching the deconstruction. Only this house keeps getting new additions by the faithful as well as the doubters. Exasperated, I throw up my hands. "You don't need to spend time on this!"

On a scale of 1 to 7, how much do you believe in God?

Have you heard of this scale? It's sometimes called The Dawkins Scale, after famed a(nti)theist Richard Dawkins (who also gave us the word & concept of "memes"!)

1 being full belief in God,7 being full belief in no god,4 being perfect uncertainty.

Feel free to answer this for yourself before you read on.

A “grid of various artistic depictions of God, showcasing diverse cultural and spiritual interpretations” from Mr. GPT (sorry)



My answer? I'm a total ignostic: the question is meaningless. “God” is not a well-defined concept.

There are some definitions of god for which almost everyone would answer “1, full belief.” “God is a metaphor for the possibility of a better way,” “God is at least the fundamental forces that started the universe and guide its evolution.”

There are some definitions of god that only small children would entertain. My five year old seems content to think of God as a large man in the sky. (She told me she thinks of God as a “he”; I said I think of God as an “it.” She thought about that, then said: “God is it. [pause] It is God. [pause] That doesn't make any sense.”)

Probably the more broadly-palatable you make the definition, the less satisfying and personal that construction of god becomes.

And yet, despite the meaninglessness of the question, people at both ends of the spectrum croon endlessly about their position on it. 

Blame the Reformation

I wonder how much of this cultural obsession with doubt we can pin on the Protestant Reformation. Emerging as it did, in parallel with the Enlightenment, is that when "faith" took on the bundle of associations it has for us now? Is that when it turned into the intellectual pursuit we think of today?

A friend wrote a dissertation on various poets of the Reformation, and they all struggled with this same “paradox of seeking certain faith in salvation by uncertain means”. Prior to that, for 1,000 years of Christianity's history (half its lifespan!), your experience of the divine was mediated by a priest. Confession, prescribed Hail Marys, attending mass, singing the songs—these things were considered equivalent with “faith.”

And before that, who knows? Certainly the Biblical texts themselves talk a lot about faith and belief, but are you certain that those concepts translate cleanly from ancient Greek, Aramaic, whatever? I don't know much about these ancient languages, but the fuzzier the concept, the less cleanly it translates. And these are fuzzy concepts!

When John said something that we translate as “whosoever believes in him shall not perish”, are you confident that he meant that you need to believe that Jesus is God? Or were you supposed to believe in Jesus the way someone today might believe in a political candidate? 

Even if the original authors did use words that translate cleanly to our current understandings of “faith” and “belief”, well, I think that’s unfortunate. As I said before.

And it's interesting to consider that all the anti-theist posturing around doubt—"look at me! I'm a 7 on that spectrum! 💪🏼💪🏼"—might not have happened if Christianity had been less obsessed with this specific version of faith.

Zealous people at both ends of the spectrum make me think of that Le Guin line from The Left Hand of Darkness:

To oppose something is to maintain it.

To be an atheist is to maintain God.

If you want to oppose the people at either end of the spectrum, don't jump to the other side of it.

Demolish the whole dichotomy.

Finding an alternative

Is it possible to live without any dichotomies? To rid yourself of all spectra by which to measure the world?

Maybe. I won't say there's not some enlightened (?) meditator out there who somehow goes around never having any judgement about any phenomena at all.

But it's unclear to me if this is even desirable! Like, the difference between kindness and cruelty seems useful. Or the difference between insight and gullibility (are those opposites?).

I argue that the faith/doubt spectrum is meaningless. Is there a better one we can come up with?

In her book The Land Is Not Empty, Sarah Augustine had a section called "Faith vs Reverence":

My experience of spirituality in the dominant culture is to value faith. Faith, from my point of view, is believing in something that I cannot see or prove with my senses. Despite overwhelming doubt, I believe anyway.

Reverence is deep respect. The Creator is evident in creation, which surrounds me. I can see it and experience it with my senses. I am part of it. Humility is acknowledging that I am not separate from creation; I am part of a web of life. I have been taught that this mutual dependence is a gift. Life is a gift.

"Faith," or belief in something I can't see, is meaningless in my experience of Indigenous cosmology.

I love this.

And what's on the other end of the spectrum? If reverence is the virtue at one end, what's at the other? What's the vice to avoid? The opposite of deep respect is…

Disregard?Carelessness?Taking-for-granted?Entitlement?

I'll happily judge people based on where they fall on the entitlement/reverence spectrum. I already do! If you're careless and entitled, you should be judged; you should feel shamed. Way more CEOs and presidents should feel shame!

I'll happily form in-groups around this, and compete for status in my group by how well I exhibit reverence. This seems like a useful dichotomy. Isn't the world dying from our species' entitlement problem?

Let's not be people of faith. Let's be people of reverence.

Not the faithful, but the reverent.

Let's not be believers. Let's be witnesses.

Witnesses to this great mystery; this co-arising; this exultant, unfolding chaos.

The world—and all its building blocks, and the universe entire—is alive, and we are its witnesses.

Don't tell me about your faith in things unseen.

Show me your attention to reality as it is.

Let us mourn and marvel this dying, transforming world together.

Show me your grief.

Show me your awe.
