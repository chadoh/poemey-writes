# In 50 Year's Time

In 50 year's time,  
we’ll look back at now,  
and we’ll think—

well, assuming humans are still around in 50 years’ time;

assuming we haven’t caused global food web collapse,

that the oceans have stayed (sufficiently) in their boundaries;  
assuming the nukes haven’t fired (or accidentally dropped),

that we bend the plot of the universe into an arc we like;

assuming

* the oceans haven’t acidified;
* the coral hasn’t died;
* there are enough small things
* for the big things to eat;

assuming
* seasons still function;
* glaciers haven’t descended;
* deserts haven’t grown
* to fill all non-flooded land;

assuming
* the magnetic field hasn’t flipped;
* the asteroid hasn’t struck;
* the rogue black hole hasn’t chanced;
* the sun hasn’t super-flared;

assuming
* the superbugs don’t win;
* the toxicity stays manageable;
* the big volcano hasn’t re-erupted,
* causing years of winter;

assuming
* the AI is agreeable;
* the arms race countervailed;
* the swarm of humanity can cooperate
* enough to preserve all we’ve learned—

i’ve forgotten what i was going to say

in 50 years’ time  
if we’re around  
we’ll look back at now  
and we’ll think
