Old Lullabies
=============

NPR story from 2007:  
woman in old people's home  
tormented by looping ghost melody.  
Musical epilepsy.  
Our hero,  
protagonist of episode,  
asks:  
What melody?  
Can you sing it?  
Gets enough  
to track it down.  
A lullaby.  
Popular ninety years before,  
in the country where she was  
raised. Sung to. Comforted.  
Some part of her  
knew she needed it again.  
  
To my daughter I sing  
something unpopular  
from a post-hardcore exvangelical act  
about faith and its loss,  
the wandering center lost  
in dystopian rumination  
quoting 1984,  
"Who do you think needs who more?"  
Book-ended with Rumi,  
"Will I meet you there?  
I'll meet you there."  
  
I wonder  
if I'm setting up future her  
for ghosts with no home;  
melodies unplaceable.  
  
When she's ninety four  
and her failing mind  
excavates the bottom few  
layers of memory,  
searching for comfort,  
will this song be there?  
Will there be a caretaker, human or AI,  
who can identify it for her?  
Will she hear it in my voice?  
Will she know it?  
Aren't parents the first to fade?  
A long life, so much of the end  
un-parented. Or under-parented.  
The senile recall lovers,  
spouses,  
first borns.  
Who will I be to her?  
To anyone?  
  
Who do I think needs who more?  
Will I meet her there?  
  
A looping ghost.  
My last remembered form.
