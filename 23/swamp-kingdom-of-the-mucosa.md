The Swamp Kingdom of the Mucosa
===============================

is where I live.  

Porous boundary where  
inner meets outer  
self meets other  
where I taste  
smell  
receive  
excrete  
become  

The one-cell linings  
where you and I blur  
in muck  
and danger  
and possibility  
and ecstasy  

So many  
want to transcend the body  
by religion or technology  
leave behind the world of slime  
live a life of only mind  

But my membranes assure me  
with every taste  
every inhale  
every ejaculation  
that the body is transcendent.  

To live is mucous.
