The poem:  


Ex Nihilo  
=========  

Once  
there was nothing.  
Then:  
burst.  
Stars all awakening,  
sun, moon, and earth.  
Trees sleepy stretching  
their branches toward sky,  
a mother and father,  
a baby's first cry.  

Once there was nothing  
but an earth full of stone  
then a tireless ocean  
churning out loam  
and seeds taking root  
and an effort called "leaf"  
then trillions who ate them  
(one of them me).  

Once I was lonely.  
Then: burst.  
An ocean called "you"  
to liven my earth.  
Rainbow and yellow.  
Pink teal and blue.  
The dry land of me.  
The ocean of you.  
Playground and Jones Pond;  
The Red Restaurant.  
Once there was nothing.  
Now look what we got!  

Once there was silence.  
Then: melody.  
Uptown Funk, Baby Shark,  
and This Is Me.  
Before we could speak  
we all learned to sing;  
our voices together,  
let the sound ring!  

Once I was empty,  
now I could burst.  
Shoulder to shoulder,  
exploring this earth.  
Worlds branch before us,  
together we'll climb.  
I'll always be yours, dears.  
You'll always be mine.
