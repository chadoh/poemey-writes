Morning: Aberration. Edge case. Exception.
==========================================

In the dark-drenched sea depths, where most creatures live,  
no one's heard of it. They don't care.  

Most of this universe knows no morning!  
Empty stretching black, distant stars unblinking.  

The brightness right here,  
our surface-dweller secret.
