Morning: Aberration. Edge case. Exception.
==========================================

In the sunless sea depths, where most creatures live,
no one's heard of it. They don't care.
Most of this universe knows no morning!
Empty stretching black, distant stars unblinking.
It's only here, this fragile in-between:
our surface-dweller secret.
