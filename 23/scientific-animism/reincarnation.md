A Reading from Tao Te Ching, with Commentary
============================================

> ## Returning to the Root
> 
> Be completely empty.  
> Be perfectly serene.  
> The ten thousand things arise together;  
> in their arising is their return.  
> Now they flower,  
> and flowering  
> sink homeward,  
> returning to the root.  
>   
> The return to the root  
> is peace.  
> Peace: to accept what must be,  
> to know what endures.  
> In that knowledge is wisdom.  
> Without it, ruin, disorder.  
>   
> To know what endures  
> is to be openhearted,  
> magnanimous,  
> regal,  
> blessed,  
> following the Tao,  
> the way that endures forever.  
> The body comes to its ending,  
> but there is nothing to fear.  

Of course, we now know    
what Lau Tzu couldn't:  
  
The body doesn't end.  
We're actually reincarnated.  
  
Not a consciousness;  
no accumulated human memory;  
no ineffable essence.  
  
But molecules.  
Building blocks.  
Spare parts.  
  
You won't get to look out  
on your life interwoven  
with ten thousand lives yet unlived,  
because you've already arrived.  
You are here,  
looking out.  
  
The brief shape called you,  
collected from bits and pieces  
of 4 billion years of prior life and non-life,  
a breathtaking  
temporary exploration  
of the many-faced Experiment;  
Reality, trying on a new shape,  
beholding itself.
