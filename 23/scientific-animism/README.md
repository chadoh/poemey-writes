Scientific Animism
==================

_Awe in Fact_  

Be delighted with what is.    
Find poetry and depth in what is.    
Recognize the mystery    
holiness    
wonder    
in what actually is.    

The ongoing project of re-aligning awe  
with the clearest emerging view,  
the endless process of discerning,  
how reality unexpectedly behaves.

Virtues
-------

1. Uncertainty

   The work is never done.  
   The picture always pixelated.  

   Have your hunches,  
   follow your faves,  

   but know  
   the data may prove you wrong.  

1. Clarity

   Not squashy-minded.  
   Not given to fancy.  
   We can actually know some things.  
   Celebrate it.  

   Roll with the data.  
   The best sign posts we have.  

1. Promiscuity

   Heaven & Earth know nothing  
   of purity or impurity.  
   
   Stick with same if it works.  
   Cross pollinate if you want.  
   Grow, adapt, expand, shrink.  
   
   Try new ways of being,  
   new ways of thinking,  
   new ways of feeling.  
   
   Intermingle,  
   find new niches,  
   thrive.  
   
   - Spiritual Promiscuity
   
     The Way is no way.  
     The Way is every Way.  
     Each offers insight.  
     Bring it back, share.  
   
   - Intellectual Promiscuity
     
     Guided by curiosity,  
     never fear.  

1. Thoughtful engagement with magical systems <sup>[2](#footnotes)</sup>

   If you erased it  
   from all memories  
   could anyone re-derive it?  
   No?  
   It's a magical system.  

   Astrology, religion, fiction:  
   good for inspiration,  
   good for self-analysis,  
   good for holding a mirror.  

   For prediction?  
   For explanation?  
   For deciding can vs should?  
   Less so.  

1. More than human

   Other creatures,  
   even those that may not think,  
   are peers.  

   Our tribe is no smaller  
   than all of humanity;  
   hopefully much larger.
