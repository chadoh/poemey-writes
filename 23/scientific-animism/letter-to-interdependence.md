Letter to Interdependence
=========================

Swirling tangled mat  
mycelium to roots to xylem to fluttering leaf  
planet bursting  

life in all its complexity  

give me more holistic religion  
tell me a story more grounded in truth  
we are special  
not alone  
not over nature  
but embedded  
the universe not made for us  
but us for it  
by it  
with it  
among  

let's not celebrate  
dominion  
let's not aspire to  
mastery  
let's not pretend our minds will last  
forever  
when we know our particles will  

eternal reuse  
eternal experiment  
form to form to form  
me, a ripple  
a current  
a swirl  
holy holy holy  

to be swept up  
in some holy narrative  
to be a part  
to marvel  
to bow  

all here already,  
just look around!  
the world made you and you get  
to see it  
touch it  
breath it  
play  
learn  
be
